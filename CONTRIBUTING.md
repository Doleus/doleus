## üõ†Ô∏è How to Contribute

### Making a Change

**Before making any significant changes, please [open an issue](https://github.com/doleus/doleus/issues).** Discussing your proposed changes ahead of time will make the contribution process smooth for everyone. Changes that were not discussed in an issue may be rejected.

A good first step is to search for open [issues](https://github.com/doleus/doleus/issues).

### Contribution Process

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2. **Clone your fork** and create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <issue-number>-your-branch-name
   # Example: git checkout -b 42-fix-metadata-bug
   ```
3. Make your changes and commit using **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)**.
4. Push your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```
5. Open a **pull request** to the `main` branch of the original repo.

## üìè Coding Standards

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **[Pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/)** for automated formatting and linting
- **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)** for commit messages

### Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Examples:

- `feat: add new metadata function for medical imaging`
- `fix: resolve issue with slice inheritance of predictions`
- `docs: update quick start guide for object detection`

### Code Formatting

Code should be formatted using:

- **Black**: ensures consistent formatting across the codebase.
- **isort**: organizes imports into sections and sorts them alphabetically.

To format your code before committing:

```bash
poetry run black .
poetry run isort .
```
